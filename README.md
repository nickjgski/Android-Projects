## Android Projects
A collection of my Android projects.

# DnD Companion
Semester project for CS 3714. Aimed at making combat easier in DnD by allowing players to attack each other through their phones.

# Burger Maker
Homework 1 for CS 3714. Allow user to select burger options and see price and calorie totals.

# Stopwatch
Homework 2 for CS 3714. User could start/stop a timer and also create laps.

# MovieDB
Homework 3 for CS 3714. Used API to fetch data on currently playing movies, displayed in a list with title and IMDb rating. Clicking on a movie took user to details page, with a larger poster, title, rating, and movie overview. The user could "like" and "unlike" movies, and have the list display only those movies.
